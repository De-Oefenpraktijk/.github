## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
-->

We have created several documents to help you understand what progress we have made and to help you get started quickly. We assume you already have had some contact with Susan and know the general idea of the platform. To gain access to things like Auth0 and the Oefenpraktijk gmail account, please contact us on Teams or on e-mail. You can also contact us there if you have any questions.
